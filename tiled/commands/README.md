# Python exporter for Cosmos

This is an external command.
Python must be in the path for it to work.

This is currently the only working method to export.

Other methods have issues with templates and revolve attributes and custom properties.

This would be replaced if the bugs are fixed in tiled.


Works with a tmx file, or a world file. World file will set the appropriate offsets, and export all maps.
