# Attempts at writing a plugin exporter for tiled

This currently cannot be finished since Tiled does not properly merge the className from the temple

The goal is to write it in type script, and compile that to javascript.
That part is working.

## Python plugins
The python plugin API is out of date, and is not as easy to explain to people how to get it working.
